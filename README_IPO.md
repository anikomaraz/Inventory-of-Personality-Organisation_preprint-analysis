This is a data analysis project for a scientific publication on the validation of the Inventory of Personality Organisaiton (IPO)

I welcome any recommendation and comments relating to this analysis in order to increase quality before submitting for publication (around June 2017). Thanks! :) 

Also, please respect preprint publication rights and do not distribute the results without permission. Thank you. 

I'll post the initial data file as soon as the article is published. Until then please e-mail me if you'd like to have the data file(s).
